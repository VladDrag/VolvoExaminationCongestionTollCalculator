1) I am not sure if there are other vehicles to be added besides the ones mentioned, so I just limited the scope to 'car' and the rest of the toll exempt vehicles; As a question - are there any other vehicles we should take into account?

2) I have used the Enum as initially added, however, I am uncertain I would, under normal circumstances use an Enum istead of an array of strings containig the names of the toll exempt vehicles; Could we have changed the enum? Was that allowed?

3) Creating an entry-point for the app over HTTP meant, for me, that we should add an API with a RESTful Post method to get the data from the user. Was that assumption correct? Would it have been better to make an MVC app or an app with a React front-end?

4) I used Swagger(open source app) for displaying the data, as I believe that this kind of visual display is appropriate to have the results in a friendly format. Was using Swagger a wrong approach? Were we allowed to use it?
